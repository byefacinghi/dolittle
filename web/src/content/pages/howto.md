# Functionality

T-reader can do 2 and a half things.

 Convert all exported chats to individual markdown conversations.

 Convert and View exported chats.

1. Modify : Adding, altering, removing or exporting individual conversations.
2. Search the entire export for keywords. * Text & Title

How it will work is that:

1. You upload your OAI archive.
2. We process it for the correct format.
3. You have the option to download to view locally, or view and curate. (You can still download everything as well.)
4. |- You can view all prompted conversations from their title only, clicking on one to expand. Intext Search is available.
5. |- Modify the chats desired and to export the ones selected, modified etc.
6. |_ Enjoy a productive extraction of past conversations for personal use.

I have also tried my best to ensure that the conversion is done on the client side so nothing else is shared. Obviously e2e encrypted.

# If You feel fine with that:
