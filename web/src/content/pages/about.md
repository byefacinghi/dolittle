I dont need to tell you why i used it, but all you need to know was that when i first heard about it in december of 23' it felt like magic, recency bias took hold and i was thinking it was going to change everything. It kind of did for me, as i was able to do much more than what i was supposed to. But it wasnt able to change the world, at least for the better.

So when i started to grow out of favour with Open AI, for a multitude of reasons, i stopped using chatGPT altogether, mainly because i didnt need it anymore and because i found out that it was using user conversations as training data. So then i exported the account conversation and deleted the account. But as a fuck you, they contained the data in a crudely uneditable and extensive html webpage. So if you have been prompting the hell out of it, that hell is going to come back to you. 

Which it prevents me from retroactively extracting anything valuable from the conversations i had with it. Even facebook's export archive isnt as bad as this.

Kind of annoying if you ask me. So i made this website that can allow you to do all of the same things i need to, and to prevent that OAI moat from ruining your productiv eonversations with it.

Enjoy. :-)
